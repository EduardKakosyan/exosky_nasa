## Project Overview

Sky Painters is an interactive web application that allows users to experience the night sky from the perspective of exoplanets across the Milky Way. By utilizing data from the **Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3)** and the **NASA Exoplanet Archive**, this app enables students to explore and visualize how the sky would appear from different exoplanets. It offers both an immersive 3D model of the galaxy and a hands-on educational tool where users can draw and name constellations.

## Features
- **Exoplanetary Viewpoints:** Select from a range of exoplanets and observe the night sky as it would appear from each of them.
- **Interactive 360-Degree Sky Map:** Explore the Milky Way in a fully navigable, 3D, 360-degree environment.
- **Constellation Drawing Tool:** Draw, name, and save your own constellations on the sky map.
- **Star Information Hover:** Hover over stars to see detailed information, such as star names, brightness, and distance.
- **Realistic Star Magnitude Adjustments:** Star brightness is adjusted based on recalculated magnitudes from the exoplanetâ€™s perspective, ensuring accurate and immersive visualization.
